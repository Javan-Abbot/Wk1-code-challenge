# Wk1-code-challenge
## studentGradeGenerator
 first i have declared a function called studentGradeGenerator
 the function then prompts the user to enter a value between 0 and 100
 the if statement validates the input to determine it can be used otherwise an alert is issued
 then we have a return statement
 finally we call/invoke the function
 

 ## speedDetector
 we declare a function that takes in a value through a prompt that the user sees
 then declare a variable points, give it a value of 0: to represent the points to be deducted when we evaluate later in our code
 the if statement validates the input from the user then proceeds to execute the other if statements accordingly
 I have used the math.floor to round down our result
 the function has a return value that is points
 then finally invoke or call the function
 

 ## payeeCalculator
 first declare varibles in the global scope
 then define a function called payeeCalculator
 the function takes in 2 values for basic salary and benefits
 these values are evaluated by the if statement, taking into consideration the edge cases
 the function returns the payee
 then invoke the function

## nhifCalculator
 the nhifCalcutor function then uses if statements to get the amount to be paid taking into consideration the basicSalary and benefits are valid figures
 the if statements calculate the nhif values according to the range given
 the function then returns the nhif value
 finally we invoke the function

## nssfCalculator
 the last function gets the nssf deductions
 it takes in a value of the tier through a prompt
 the value is validated by the if statement
 an alert is isued depending on the condition arrived at
 the function returns a nssf value
 then we invoke the function

 once again we declare variables in the global scope for relief offered by goverment
 other variables are for grossSalary and netPay
 then declare a function to get the net pay
 return the netpay
 then finally invoke the function to get the netPay
